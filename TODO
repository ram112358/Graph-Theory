todo:
- add a place piece function that can account for a taurus (just out of bounds stuff) to make "ownership" markers easier to make
- make the boards actually square
- have a persistent board that gets updated instead of just reprinting it
- options for square,cylinder,taurus
- make a build that people can download and run without having a python compiler
- detect what kind of piece and show "ownership markers"
- have option for marking when pieces are attacking each other
